This plugin let's you create basic symbols that adjust to the dimensions of the text layer. Something like Dynamic Button but with symbols.
For a more in depth look you can [read my post about it](http://blog.herrkris.de/dynamic-buttons-with-symbols-and-sketch/).

## Updates

### Version 2.0.0-beta.1
* Special naming of text layer is no longer necessary
* Therefor removed "Update Dimensions" menu entry
* Symbol background no longer needs to be bigger to correctly resize the symbol itself

### Version 1.1
* Optimized detection logic of text layer
* Symbol can now easily be updated when the text layer name is changed (Cmd + Alt + D)
* Icon support

### Version 1.0
* First Version
* Basic updating of dimensions
* Helper to create symbol

## Todos
- [x] Allow more then two layers (e.g. for buttons with icons)
- [x] Try to get the button padding not from the layer's name but from the it's dimensions
