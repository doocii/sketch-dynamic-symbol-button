# Dynamic symbol button for Sketch 3.5+

[Download](https://github.com/herrkris/sketch-dynamic-symbol-button/archive/master.zip)

This plugin let's you create basic symbols that adjust to the dimensions of the text layer. Something like Dynamic Button but with symbols.
For a more in depth look you can [read my post about it](http://blog.herrkris.de/dynamic-buttons-with-symbols-and-sketch/).

## Updates

### Version 1.2
* Support Sketch 43 and 44

### Version 1.1
* Optimized detection logic of text layer
* Symbol can now easily be updated when the text layer name is changed (Cmd + Alt + D)
* Icon support

### Version 1.0
* First Version
* Basic updating of dimensions
* Helper to create symbol

## Todos
- [x] Allow more then two layers (e.g. for buttons with icons)
- [ ] Try to get the button padding not from the layer's name but from the it's dimensions
